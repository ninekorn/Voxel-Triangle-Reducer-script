# Voxel-Triangle-Reducer-script

it's not really a LOD (level of detail) solution - It's a vertex and triangle reducer for voxel based minecraft chunks.

Using unity 2017.4.26f1 - my script is making faces of minecraft chunks faces merge together as rectangles or cubic faces to cover larger areas and bring the number of vertices and triangles displayed on the screen to a lower amount.

The chunk creation is based on the old Minecraft tutorial of Craig Perko here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHQ-Kykp_s&ab_channel=CraigPerko. There are a lot of Triangulation techniques and scripts everywhere that one can use to achieve 3d terrain but i wanted to code my own. It's very basic, and not necessarily useful if there are not a lot of faces on the same axis plane.

thank you for reading me.
