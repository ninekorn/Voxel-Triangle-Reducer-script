# Voxel-Triangle-Reducer-script
NO LOD - My implementation of a triangle reducer for voxel based minecraft chunks. 

Using unity 2017.4.26f1 - my script is making faces of minecraft chunks faces merge together as rectangles or cubic faces to cover larger areas and bring the number of vertices and triangles displayed on the screen to a lower amount.

The chunk creation is based on the old Minecraft tutorial of Craig Perko here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHQ-Kykp_s&ab_channel=CraigPerko.

thank you for reading me.
